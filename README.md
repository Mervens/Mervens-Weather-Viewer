Create a site that enables the user to input a city to a search bar,  
and the used API will retrieve the  
Temperature,  
Wind Conditions,  
and Humidity Forecast  
for the 5 upcoming day week of the city chosen.  

This informaiton will be saved in localstorage so one can view their recent city searches.
